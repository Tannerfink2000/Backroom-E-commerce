# Backroom-E-commerce

This backend code defines how an application interacts with a database for specific types of data, namely products, categories, and tags. It uses JavaScript and a library called Sequelize to make the database easier to work with. The code includes different actions (like getting, creating, updating, or deleting data) for each data type. This involves looking up data based on certain conditions, updating it or adding new data based on information received from a user, or removing data. For example, a user might request to view all products, create a new category, or delete a specific tag, and this code defines how the application should respond to those requests. Each type of data also has relationships to other data types (like a product belonging to a category or having multiple tags), and these relationships are defined in the code as well.
